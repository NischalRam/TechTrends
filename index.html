  <h2>Importance of Analysis</h2>


  <p>Many people are currently searching for jobs, whether they have been affected by recent layoffs or are fresh graduates. This search is especially crucial for international students who have a limited 90-day period after starting their Optional Practical Training (OPT) to secure employment. However, many individuals are feeling lost and uncertain about where to look for jobs and how to find ones that match their preferences.</p>
  <p> To help with this dilemma, we will develop a user-friendly data visualization dashboard. This dashboard allows users to easily explore companies based on their desired location and industry. Whether someone wants to work in tech, healthcare, finance, or any other field, they can quickly find relevant companies hiring in their preferred City. This tool aims to simplify the job search process, providing clarity and guidance during this critical time of career transition.</p>




  <p>Analyzing this data yields valuable insights into global trends within the startup ecosystem, investor preferences, geographic distribution of unicorns, industry dynamics, and factors contributing to their success. Utilizing data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards facilitates a deeper understanding of these insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding investment, entrepreneurship, and industry strategy.</p>
